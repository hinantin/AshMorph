Reduplication Phenomena in pan-Ashaninka
========================================

#### Verbal reduplication

Verbal reduplication indicates urgency `(1)`, repetition/countinued-action `(3)`, intensity `(2)`, or plurality of paticipants `(4)`.

```
1) ma 'to.do' -> ma~ma 'to.do.quickly' 
```

Our analysis of the collected text corpus, shows that pan-Ashaninka presents both partial reduplication 'bounded copy' `(2)` and total reduplication 'unbounded copy' `(1, 3)` as productive morphological operations.

```
2) kov 'to.want' -> ko~kov 'to.prefer.strongly' 

3) koniha 'to.appear' -> koniha~koniha 'to.appear.again-and-again'
```

pan-Ashaninka possesses partial and total reduplication of its verbal roots on their own or accompanied by epenthetic prefixes/suffixes as well as subject prefixes and a irrealis infix `(5)`.

```
5) noirink 'I.descend.from.a.summit' -> noi~noirinka 'I.descend.from.a.summit.again-and-again' 
```
